# Chotha

## Why?

So that we don't waste time before exam by reading the whole book and asking each other how to do wot to do.

### For this we need a website that:

- that provides all the necessary notes/links/refs about hard to understand topic in a student-friendly way.
- that also provides bangla explanation but technical terms used in english.
- that have question bank (and possible solution of them) from renowed unsversities.

## Essential features:

- [x] To be able to post notes.
- [ ] Adding like-dislike or upvote-downvote system to rate a certain note/post.
- [ ] Different category of topics for different subjects from different department. For example "pipelining" from "computer architecture" from "CSE".
- [ ] Contribution feature. Since all the notes/chothas will be from community we need to implement a feature where people can send note in markdown format and we publish it as a post. Which format they send is a debatable topic.
- [ ] Comment section for queries.
- [ ] Being able to request update. (This will be challenging)
- [ ] Separate question-bank section.
